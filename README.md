## What is TripMode?

TripMode is an essential utility for anyone who wants to take control of their internet usage on a Mac. It acts as a selective firewall, allowing you to choose which applications are permitted to go online. This is particularly valuable when you are connected to a metered network or when you need to conserve bandwidth for important tasks.

The application is incredibly user-friendly. Once installed, it resides in your menu bar and activates automatically when you connect to a new or untrusted network. You’ll receive a prompt to allow or deny internet access for each app that tries to connect. This ensures that only the software you trust can use your data.

Beyond simple blocking, TripMode offers detailed insights into your data consumption. You can view how much data each app has used over time, set usage alerts, and even create custom profiles for different networks. This makes it perfect for frequent travelers, remote workers, students, and anyone who relies on stable and economical internet access.

TripMode is fully compatible with the latest macOS versions and runs efficiently on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. It requires minimal system resources and operates silently in the background, providing peace of mind without interrupting your workflow.
